# ðŸ¦  COVID-19 Data Analysis ðŸ§¬

## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project performs an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) on COVID-19 data, aiming to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about the pandemic's global spread. The analysis includes examining case numbers, death rates, and vaccination progress across different countries and regions. By visualizing this data, we can better understand the impact of COVID-19 and identify areas where further attention is needed.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- **`covid_19_analysis.ipynb`**: The main notebook where the EDA is conducted. It includes data cleaning, analysis, and visualization steps.
- **`files`**: Folder with all the graphs etc.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

1. Analyze COVID-19 case numbers, death rates, and recovery trends across various countries.
2. Visualize the impact of the pandemic over time using different data visualizations.
3. Compare vaccination progress between countries and its relationship with case numbers and deaths.
4. Provide insights that can help with understanding the pandemic's trajectory and potential future outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Data Sources

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/themrityunjaypathak/covid-cases-and-deaths-worldwide?resource=download
This project utilizes publicly available COVID-19 datasets. These datasets contain information on daily cases, death rates, vaccination counts, and more for countries around the world.
(datasets are not included in this repository and need to be downloaded)

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features of the Notebook

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing and incomplete data.
   - Cleaning the dataset to make it ready for analysis.
  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
   - Summary statistics of case numbers, deaths, and vaccinations.
   - Time-series analysis to understand how the pandemic evolved over time.
   - Country-by-country comparisons to analyze the spread and impact of COVID-19 globally.
  
3. **Visualization**: 
  - maps covering distribution based on different attributes
  - sorting out and visualization of countries based on number of deaths
  - relations between different attributes
  - correlation heatmap
  
4. **Insights and Findings**: 
   - Key insights into the global spread of COVID-19.
   - Countries with the highest and lowest rates of vaccination.
   - Relationships between vaccination rates, cases, and deaths.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**: Main language for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **NumPy**: For performing numerical computations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and running the analysis interactively.
